# Springboot Beginner Sample

### Purpose

This repo contains practical Springboot code for a REST API for CRUD for a student
database. It demonstrates the concepts of Springboot including Rest Controllers, Services and Repositories and other
core concepts.
The code makes use of Spring Data JPA which the individual can decide to configure any database of their choice(I used
Postgres) for my own setup.
